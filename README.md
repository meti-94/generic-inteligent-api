# generic-inteligent-api


Welcome to the AI Deployment API project! This repository provides a generic API designed to deploy AI-powered applications seamlessly. Built with Django and uWSGI, and encapsulated within Docker containers, this project ensures scalable, efficient, and reproducible deployments for AI models and applications.

## Features

- **Django Framework**: Robust and scalable web framework for building the API.
- **uWSGI**: Application server container for running the API, ensuring high performance.
- **Docker**: Isolate and package the application with all its dependencies for consistent deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Django (for customizing or extending the API).

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meti-94/generic-inteligent-api.git
   cd generic-inteligent-api
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-deployment-api .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-deployment-api
   ```

The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.


## Customizing

To extend or customize the API to better fit your AI application's needs, dive into the Django application structure. Ensure any additional dependencies are added to the Dockerfile.

## Deployment

The encapsulation in Docker containers ensures the API can be easily deployed to various cloud platforms or on-premises servers that support Docker.
